Therefore, only a brief introduction is provided here, and contents of the Chinese version such as translation philosophy and word selection will not be translated into English.*
# About this Project
This is a Minecraft Java Edition resource pack including an overhauled `lzh` (Literary Classical Chinese) translation for the game and many mods.

The `lzh` translation was added to the game since 1.17.1. As a community-contributed project, it still contains many unprofessional elements. Based on my personal preference, I created this resource pack to replace the original language pack while also covering the mods in my modpack. To put more effort on polishing the translation itself, this project is currently based on 1.20.1 and doesn't follow updating immediately.
# How to Use
This project is just like any Minecraft resource pack, just download the zip file from Release, put it in the correct directory and it shall work. The language name will appear as 文言（華夏） in the language list.
